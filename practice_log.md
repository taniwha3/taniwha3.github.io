### Day 1 (Completed)
- Learned the basic riff using alternate picking (down-up-down-up)

- Modern Guitar Book:
    - Completed exercises through #8
    - Practiced "One, Two, Three, Four" duet
- **Focus areas**: Timing consistency, chord transitions, chromatic runs for finger independence
- **Target areas**: Power chord transitions and picking speed

### Day 4 (Completed)
- Rock Discipline stretches (completed all exercises)
- Bernth #365 Practice Toolbox, same exercise as last week but at 50% speed
  - Performance was messy toward the end, need more practice at this tempo
- Modern Guitar Book - continued working through exercises

## Notes
- Right hand tension has improved - continue focusing on relaxed wrist
- Low E string picking force more consistent today
- Leavitt exercises are helpful supplements for developing reading skills alongside the curriculum
- Consider adding more ear training to daily routine
- Paranoid will help develop faster picking technique needed in later songs
