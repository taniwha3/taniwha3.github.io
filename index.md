> Created on: 2025-02-27 | Last Updated: 2025-03-01

Welcome to my personal notebook. This site contains structured learning materials, technical guides, and personal notes.

> **Note**: This is my personal notebook to keep track of things I am interested in and my progress with them. Some content has been created in collaboration with an LLM assistant. This site is not intended to be a published article or professional resource - those I would author entirely myself. This is simply where I organize my learning journey.
