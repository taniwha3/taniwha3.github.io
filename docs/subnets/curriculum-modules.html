<h1 id="subnetting-curriculum-modules-complete-specification">Subnetting Curriculum Modules - Complete Specification</h1>

<p>Below is a self-contained, step-by-step curriculum that takes a complete beginner from &ldquo;What is an IP address?&rdquo; to confidently designing and verifying subnet schemes. Everything is organized as modules; each module contains:
- <strong>Objectives</strong> – what the learner must be able to do before moving on.
- <strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong> – core content and suggested learning tasks.
- <strong>Assessment (gate)</strong> – an explicit check-point the learner must pass.
- <strong>Likely sticking points &amp; remedies</strong> – issues a first-time learner almost always meets and how to address them early.</p>

<p>No prior programming is expected and only the arithmetic normally covered by high-school algebra is assumed. You may teach the program in 30–45 minute sessions or bundle two modules into a single 90-minute class depending on pace and schedule.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-0-orientation-pre-assessment-optional-but-recommended">Module 0: Orientation &amp; Pre-Assessment (optional but recommended)</h2>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Make the student emotionally comfortable and capture a baseline</p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Describe, in plain language, what &ldquo;subnetting&rdquo; achieves (divide a network, control broadcast domains, conserve addresses).
- Explain why even a home user benefits (e.g., IoT isolation).</p>

<p><strong>Activities</strong>:
- Five-minute &ldquo;tour&rdquo; of an IP packet.
- Ask learner to write two things they hope to be able to do by the end.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Short reflective paragraph: &ldquo;Subnetting matters because…&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: Intimidation. Emphasize: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use only addition, subtraction, powers of 2, and some logical AND.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-1-positional-number-systems-powers-of-two">Module 1: Positional Number Systems &amp; Powers of Two</h2>

<p><em>Math foundation #1</em></p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Convert numbers 0 – 255 between decimal and binary without a calculator.
- List the values of 2⁰ through 2⁷ from memory.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
1. Positional review – identical to decimal but base 2.
2. Eight-bit chart – learner fills a row of boxes labelled 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1.
3. Mental game: &ldquo;What is the highest power of two less than ___?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Assessment (gate)</strong>: Worksheet: 10 random decimals → binary and 10 random binaries → decimal in &lt; 10 min; ≥ 90% correct.</p>

<p><strong>Likely sticking points &amp; remedies</strong>:
- Dropping leading zeros – remind that each IP octet must keep all eight bits for clarity.
- Memorizing powers of two – create flash-cards; include 2⁸ (256) and 2¹⁶ (65,536) for later.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-2-bitwise-logic-without-programming">Module 2: Bitwise Logic Without Programming</h2>

<p><em>Math foundation #2</em></p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Perform manual AND and OR operations on two eight-bit binary numbers.
- Explain why AND is used to discover &ldquo;network portion&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Truth table drill (1 &amp; 1 = 1, everything else = 0).
- Colored-pen exercise: overlay mask and address, highlight.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Given IP = 11000000 10101000 00000001 00100011 (192.168.1.35) and mask = 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 (255.255.255.0), hand-calculate the network address; must answer 192.168.1.0.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>:
- Writing long strings of 1s/0s incorrectly – teach grouping into nibbles (4 bits).
- Mixing AND vs OR – mnemonic: &ldquo;AND narrows&rdquo;.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-3-ipv4-address-anatomy">Module 3: IPv4 Address Anatomy</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Break an address into four octets, show each in binary and decimal.
- Describe historical class A/B/C only for context, not as current design rule.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- &ldquo;32-bit string-to-dotted-quad&rdquo; mini-lab.
- Visual analogy: street (network) vs house (host).</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Label each part of 10.15.7.<sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> as network vs host.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: Thinking classes still matter – stress that CIDR replaced them in 1993.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-4-subnet-masks-cidr-notation">Module 4: Subnet Masks &amp; CIDR Notation</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Translate between dotted-decimal mask and slash notation up to /30.
- Explain why /31 and /32 behave specially.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Build a &ldquo;mask ladder&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>  /8  = 255.0.0.0
  /9  = 255.128.0.0
  ...
  /24 = 255.255.255.0
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Paper exercise: slide the &ldquo;bar&rdquo; one bit at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Provide five masks in either form; learner must supply the other form and number of host bits.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: /24 vs 255.255.255.0 confusion – repetitive drills; keep ladder sheet posted.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-5-fixed-length-subnet-calculations">Module 5: Fixed-Length Subnet Calculations</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Given network &amp; new prefix, calculate: number of subnets, hosts per subnet, block size, first &amp; last usable, broadcast.
- Recognize invalid host addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
1. Formula review – hosts = 2^(host bits) – 2, subnets = 2^(borrowed bits).
2. Step-by-step worksheet for 192.168.0.0/24 subdivided into /26, /28, etc.
3. Speed rounds: &ldquo;What subnet does 172.22.37.<sup>129</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> belong to?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Comprehensive problem set (5 networks, graded by instructor or answer key). Must score ≥ 80% and self-explain any error.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>:
- Off-by-one: forgetting to reserve network &amp; broadcast.
- Using decimal math on block size: always derive from binary boundary first.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-6-variable-length-subnet-masking-vlsm-address-planning">Module 6: Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) &amp; Address Planning</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Allocate subnets of different sizes from a single pool without overlap.
- Prioritize largest to smallest when carving.
- Produce a clean address plan table.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Realistic scenario: HQ + 3 branches needing 250, 60, 30, 14 hosts.
- Draw visual binary tree to show split points.
- Spreadsheet lab so learner sees gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Design a VLSM plan for 10.10.0.0/22 given four department sizes; instructor checks for no overlap, correct ranges.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>:
- Forgetting to sort by size – enforce rule: &ldquo;biggest networks first.&rdquo;
- Address wastage – calculate utilization % as feedback.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-7-subnetting-in-practice-routing-acl-implications">Module 7: Subnetting in Practice: Routing &amp; ACL Implications</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Explain how routers use the mask to make forwarding decisions (longest-prefix match).
- Predict which subnets a summarized route covers.
- Identify when two ACL entries overlap because of subnet math.</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Demo with a packet tracer / simulator (no coding).
- ACL overlap puzzle: which rule wins?</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Given a routing table, determine next-hop for three sample destinations.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: Misreading &ldquo;longest prefix&rdquo; – analogy: exact street address vs only ZIP code.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-8-ipv6-subnet-fundamentals-optional-but-valuable">Module 8: IPv6 Subnet Fundamentals (Optional but Valuable)</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Recognize 128-bit address, hexadecimal quartet notation.
- Explain the concept &ldquo;/64 is the normal host subnet.&rdquo;
- Calculate simple IPv6 sub-prefixes (/56 → /60, /64, /126).</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Compression rules ::/ etc.
- Compare IPv4 /30 to IPv6 /126 for point-to-point links.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Convert 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0200:00ff:fe00:0042 to compressed form and list network vs interface ID for /64.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: Hexadecimal unfamiliarity – quick refresher; show that hex-to-binary is 1:4 mapping.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="module-9-verification-troubleshooting-tools">Module 9: Verification &amp; Troubleshooting Tools</h2>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:
- Use ipcalc (Linux/WSL or web), ping, traceroute, and whois to verify subnet plans.
- Spot common misconfigurations (mask mismatch, overlapping ranges, wrong gateway).</p>

<p><strong>Key ideas &amp; activities</strong>:
- Live lab: mis-configured VM network adapter; student must fix.
- Checklist template for real deployments.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Instructor deliberately breaks one parameter; learner diagnoses and documents fix.</p>

<p><strong>Sticking points</strong>: Assuming the math is wrong when the config is – teach to check both.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="graduation-capstone">Graduation Capstone</h2>

<p>Design a complete address plan for a fictitious 12-site company (HQ + 11 branches, VPN, guest Wi-Fi, management VLANs).</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: addressing spreadsheet, summarization map, and one-page rationale. Oral defense encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Pass mark</strong>: 100% routability, &lt; 10% wastage in any /24-sized block, and correct masking throughout.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="general-study-tips">General Study Tips</h2>

<ol>
<li>Paper first, software second – manual work cements intuition.</li>
<li>Flash cards for powers of two, masks, and slash equivalents.</li>
<li>Teach-back – have learner explain today&rsquo;s topic to a rubber duck or peer.</li>
</ol>
