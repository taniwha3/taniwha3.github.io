## Practice Guidelines

### Time Commitment
- **Daily Practice**: 1-2 hours minimum recommended (3-4 hours optimal for faster progression)
- **Weekly Time**: 10-15 hours minimum, 20-25 hours for optimal progress
- **Consistency**: Regular daily practice is more effective than occasional long sessions
- **Focused Sessions**: Quality of practice is more important than quantity - deliberate, focused practice with proper technique

### Progression Guidelines
- **Mastery Before Moving On**: Move to the next song/exercise when you can play the current one at 90-95% of the target tempo with proper technique
- **Partial Mastery**: For complex songs, it's acceptable to move forward after mastering key sections that focus on the targeted technique
- **Weekly Schedule**: Spend 1-2 weeks on each entry depending on difficulty and your progress
- **Technique Verification**: Record yourself regularly to verify technique and identify areas for improvement
- **Adjust As Needed**: If a particular week feels too challenging, it's okay to spend additional time or break it into smaller components

### Assessment Points
- **Quarterly Review**: Every 12-13 weeks, take time to review all techniques covered
- **Year-End Assessment**: Before advancing to the next year, ensure you can perform at least 80% of the songs from the current year
- **Performance Expectations**:
  - **Early Years (1-3)**: Reading from tabs/notation is acceptable while learning, but aim to memorize core sections
  - **Middle Years (4-6)**: Memorization of most pieces recommended, with notation as reference for complex sections
  - **Advanced Years (7-10)**: Full memorization expected for performance pieces; reading notation for learning new material only
- **Progress Metrics**: Track your speeds, technique cleanliness, and endurance to measure improvement
